- 👋 Hi, I’m @paigeelizabethg
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, astronomy, and horror movies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code! I'm a total beginner...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything with anyone who would be willing to mentor me! I've done little coding projects for fun in the past, but I'm only now trying to seriously learn how to code.
